Welcome to Ian Nowacki's steganography tool.

On the script IanNowackiSteganography.py, the main entry to program starts on line  213.

You can run this script as is and it will prompt for a user text input 
on the terminal which is then encoded onto the image file IMAGE_02.bmp and the
terminal then displays the size of the message in pixels, this value is
encoded within the message itself for decoding purposes. On current setup the 
encoded image is then immediately decoded and the message is displayed back on the 
terminal. 

On lines 227 & 230, there are the calls to encode and decode functions with
comments explaining the arguments they take and what the start offset value variable is.
